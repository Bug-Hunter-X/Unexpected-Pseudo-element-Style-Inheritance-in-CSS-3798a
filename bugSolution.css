The solution involves ensuring that the pseudo-element's styling is confined to itself and doesn't leak to its parent element's children:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
  position: relative; /* Necessary for absolute positioning of the pseudo-element */
}

.container::before {
  content: 'This is a pseudo-element.';
  background-color: lightcoral;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}

.container span {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

By explicitly positioning the pseudo-element using `position: absolute`, we isolate its styling from the rest of the container, resolving the unintended inheritance.
