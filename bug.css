The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where a pseudo-element selector is unexpectedly overriding a more specific selector:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container::before {
  content: 'This is a pseudo-element.';
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.container span {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

Notice how the `span` element inside `.container` inherits the background color of the pseudo-element and not the one defined for the `.container` class. This is counterintuitive because the `span` selector is more specific.

This behavior is caused by pseudo-elements affecting the element's styling in ways that are not immediately apparent, especially when dealing with complex CSS rules and inheritance.
